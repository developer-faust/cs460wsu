how to login:
-----------------
main: // invoked by exec("login /dev/ttyxx")
1. set tty to argv[1]. i.e. /dev/ttyxx
2. close out all inherited descriptors
3. settty(tty): store the tty string in PROC.tty[] used for putc
4. open the tty as stdin stdout stderr
5. allow the control -c signal interrupt to kill proc on this tty
5. loop forever:
	1. prompt for user name and password and initialize the USER struct
	2. verify the username and password
	   Case success:   // Change to user account and execute start program

verify(USER *user):
1. Verify user name and password from /etc/passwd file
1. open the password_file
2. read the file line by line
3. tokenize the line to get username and again to get password
4. if match then continue to tokenize and initialize the struct variables by using strcpy
5. return 0 if success -1 failure
